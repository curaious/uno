# Introduction

**Uno LLM Gateway** is a high-performance, open-source gateway designed to simplify how developers and teams interact with Large Language Models (LLMs). It acts as a bridge between your application and multiple LLM providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini, providing a unified API, enhanced security, and deep observability.

## Why Use Uno LLM Gateway?

Managing multiple LLM integrations can quickly become complex. Uno solves this by centralizing configuration and providing production-grade features out of the box.

### Key Features

- **Unified API**: Interact with different LLM providers using a single, consistent request/response format.
- **Virtual Keys**: Protect your provider API keys by using Uno-generated virtual keys in your client applications.
- **Centralized Configuration**: Manage models, fallback logic, and provider settings through a user-friendly UI without changing code.
- **Deep Observability**: Automatically capture traces, token usage, and latency metrics for every request using ClickHouse and OpenTelemetry.
- **Direct & Gateway Modes**: Choose between maximum features (Gateway Mode) or minimal latency (Direct Mode) using the same SDK.
- **MCP Support**: Built-in support for Model Context Protocol (MCP) to extend your LLMs with custom tools and data.

## Architecture

Uno consists of three main components:

1. **Gateway Server**: The core engine that routes requests, manages keys, and collects telemetry.
2. **Dashboard (UI)**: A React-based interface for configuring providers, projects, and monitoring usage.
3. **Golang SDK**: A flexible SDK that makes it easy to integrate Uno into your Go applications.
