title: Gateway vs. Direct Mode
description: Understand the two modes of operation for the Uno SDK and how to choose the right one for your application.
---

The Uno Golang SDK is designed for flexibility, allowing you to choose between two primary modes of operation based on your architecture and requirements: **Gateway Mode** and **Direct Mode**.

## Gateway Mode

In Gateway Mode, the SDK acts as a client to the **Uno Gateway Server**. Instead of communicating directly with LLM providers, all requests are routed through the gateway.

### Key Benefits
- **Virtual Keys:** Use a single Uno virtual key instead of managing multiple provider-specific keys in your application.
- **Centralized Configuration:** Update models, fallbacks, and provider settings through the Uno UI without redeploying your code.
- **Enhanced Observability:** Automatically capture traces, usage metrics, and logs for every LLM call.
- **Governance:** Implement rate limiting and access control at the gateway level.

### Example Initialization

```go
import (
    "github.com/praveen001/uno/pkg/sdk"
)

func main() {
    // Initialize the client in Gateway Mode
    client, err := sdk.NewClient(&sdk.ClientOptions{
        Endpoint:    "https://your-uno-gateway.com",
        VirtualKey:  "ux_...",          // Your Uno Virtual Key
        ProjectName: "my-awesome-app",  // Your Project Name
    })
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // Requests will now be routed through the gateway
}
```

## Direct Mode

In Direct Mode, the SDK communicates directly with the LLM providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic). The Uno Gateway Server is not involved in the request path.

### Key Benefits
- **Minimal Latency:** Eliminates the extra network hop to the gateway server.
- **No Infrastructure Dependency:** Run the SDK without hosting or connecting to an external gateway.
- **Full Control:** All configurations are defined explicitly in your application code.

### Example Initialization

```go
import (
    "github.com/praveen001/uno/pkg/sdk"
    "github.com/praveen001/uno/pkg/sdk/adapters"
    "github.com/praveen001/uno/pkg/llm"
)

func main() {
    // Initialize the client in Direct Mode with in-memory configuration
    client, err := sdk.NewClient(&sdk.ClientOptions{
        LLMConfigs: adapters.NewInMemoryConfigStore([]*adapters.ProviderConfig{
            {
                ProviderName: llm.ProviderNameOpenAI,
                Keys: []*adapters.ProviderKey{
                    {
                        Name: "Production Key",
                        Key:  "sk-...", // Your OpenAI API Key
                    },
                },
            },
        }),
    })
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // Requests are made directly to OpenAI
}
```

## Which Mode Should You Use?

- **Use Gateway Mode** if you are building a production-grade application where you need observability, centralized management of multiple LLMs, and secure key handling.
- **Use Direct Mode** for local development, small-scale prototypes, or performance-critical paths where every millisecond counts and you don't need the gateway's management features.
