description: Learn how to use reasoning models and handle reasoning steps with the Uno SDK.
---

Reasoning models (like OpenAI's `o1` and `o3` series) perform internal chain-of-thought processing before generating a final answer. The Uno SDK allows you to configure reasoning parameters and access these reasoning steps.

## Enabling Reasoning

To use reasoning features, you typically need to use a compatible model and configure the `Reasoning` parameters in your request.

```go
import (
    "github.com/praveen001/uno/pkg/llm/responses"
    "github.com/praveen001/uno/internal/utils"
)

request := &responses.Request{
    Input: responses.InputUnion{
        OfString: utils.Ptr("If 2+4=6, what would be 22+44=?"),
    },
    Parameters: responses.Parameters{
        Reasoning: &responses.ReasoningParam{
            // Request detailed reasoning summary
            Summary: utils.Ptr("detailed"),
        },
    },
}
```

## Handling Reasoning Output

Reasoning steps are returned as distinct output items, separate from the final text response.

### Example: Handling Unary Reasoning

In a unary request, you can check the `Output` for reasoning messages.

```go
resp, err := model.NewResponses(ctx, request)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

for _, output := range resp.Output {
    if output.OfReasoning != nil {
        fmt.Println("Reasoning Steps:")
        for _, s := range output.OfReasoning.Summary {
            fmt.Printf("- %s\n", s.Text)
        }
    }
}
```

### Example: Handling Streaming Reasoning

When streaming, reasoning steps are emitted as chunks. You can detect when a reasoning item is completed.

```go
stream, err := model.NewStreamingResponses(ctx, request)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

for chunk := range stream {
    if chunk.ChunkType() == "response.output_item.done" {
        item := chunk.OfOutputItemDone.Item
        
        if item.Type == "reasoning" {
            fmt.Println("Reasoning completed.")
            for _, s := range item.Summary {
                fmt.Printf("Summary: %s\n", s.Text)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Encrypted Reasoning Content

Providers returns an encrypted reasoning content. You can include a parameter to request this content. This is recommended to pass this back to the model in the subsequent calls in a multi-turn conversation.

```go
Parameters: responses.Parameters{
    Include: []responses.Includable{
        responses.IncludableReasoningEncryptedContent,
    },
}
```
