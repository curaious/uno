<div className="max-w-8xl mx-auto relative" style={{ paddingTop: '30px' }}>

Uno is a comprehensive platform for building LLM-powered applications. It offers two complementary products:

- **Uno SDK** — A Golang SDK for making LLM calls, building AI agents, and orchestrating complex workflows across multiple providers.
- **Uno Gateway** — A server that acts as an LLM gateway with virtual key management, observability, and a no-code agent builder with a built-in conversational UI.

## Uno SDK

A Golang SDK for developers who want fine-grained control over LLM interactions and agent orchestration. The Uno SDK abstracts away provider differences, letting you switch between OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini with a single line change. Build agents, connect MCP tools, and get structured outputs—all through a unified API.

### Core Capabilities

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Multi-Provider Support" icon="shuffle">
    Write once, deploy anywhere. Seamlessly switch between OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini without rewriting your application logic.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Agent Framework" icon="robot">
    Build sophisticated AI agents with system instructions, tools, conversation history, and multi-step reasoning out of the box.
  </Card>
  <Card title="MCP Integration" icon="plug">
    Connect to any Model Context Protocol (MCP) server and extend your agents with external tools and resources.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Structured Outputs" icon="brackets-curly">
    Define JSON schemas to ensure consistent, validated responses from LLMs—perfect for data extraction and API responses.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Quick Examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="LLM Calls">
    Use the SDK as a lightweight wrapper to call any LLM provider. Simply change the `Provider` and `Model` to switch between providers—your application logic stays the same:

```go
model := client.NewLLM(sdk.LLMOptions{
    Provider: llm.ProviderNameOpenAI,
    Model:    "gpt-4.1-mini",
})

resp, _ := model.NewResponses(ctx, &responses.Request{
    Instructions: utils.Ptr("You are a helpful assistant."),
    Input: responses.InputUnion{
        OfString: utils.Ptr("What is the capital of France?"),
    },
})
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Agents">
    Create agents with tools, memory, and multi-step reasoning. Agents work the same way across all providers:

```go
agent := client.NewAgent(&sdk.AgentOptions{
    Name:        "Assistant",
    Instruction: client.Prompt("You are a helpful assistant."),
    LLM: client.NewLLM(sdk.LLMOptions{
        Provider: llm.ProviderNameOpenAI,
        Model:    "gpt-4o-mini",
    }),
})

out, _ := agent.Execute(ctx, &agents.AgentInput{
    Messages: []responses.InputMessageUnion{
        responses.UserMessage("Hello!"),
    },
})
```
  </Tab>

## Uno Gateway

Uno Gateway is a server that provides two key capabilities:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="LLM Gateway" icon="server">
    Point any OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini SDK at the gateway and unlock virtual keys, rate limiting, and request logging.

    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="Virtual Keys" icon="shield-check">
        Protect your provider API keys. Generate virtual keys with usage limits and revoke them instantly when needed.
      </Card>
    <Card title="Drop-in Replacement" icon="chart-line">
        Point your existing OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google GenAI client to the gateway and get access to all gateway features.
    </Card>
      <Card title="Deep Observability" icon="chart-line">
        Track every request with OpenTelemetry. Monitor token usage, latency, and costs with ClickHouse-powered analytics.
      </Card>
      <Card title="Request Logging" icon="list">
        Every LLM call is logged with full request/response details for debugging and compliance.
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>

    ### Drop-in Replacement

    Point any existing SDK to the gateway—it just works:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Go">
```go
client := openai.NewClient(
    option.WithBaseURL("http://localhost:6060/api/gateway/openai"),
    option.WithAPIKey("your-virtual-key"),
)
```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Python">
```python
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:6060/api/gateway/openai",
    api_key="your-virtual-key",
)
```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="TypeScript">
```typescript
const client = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: "http://localhost:6060/api/gateway/openai",
  apiKey: "your-virtual-key",
});
```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>


### API Keys

      Manage provider keys, virtual keys with rate limits defined per key.

    ### Gateway Logs

    View all LLM requests with full details—prompts, responses, token usage, and latency metrics.

    </Frame>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="No-Code Agent Builder" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Beyond proxying LLM calls, Uno Gateway includes a complete no-code agent builder. Define model parameters, system prompts, MCP tool servers, and output schemas—all from the dashboard.

    </Frame>

    ### Conversational UI

    Interact with your agents through a built-in chat interface. Test prompts, debug tool calls, and iterate on your agents in real-time.

      <img src="/images/conversational-ui.png" alt="Conversational UI for Agents" />
    </Frame>

    ### Agent Traces

    Every agent invocation is captured with detailed traces. Debug complex multi-step workflows and monitor performance across all your agents.
